# Visual AI Trading Assistant for MetaTrader 5

[](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A sophisticated trading assistant that automates market analysis by combining real-time **MetaTrader 5 API data** with **Google Gemini's visual intelligence**. The system captures trading chart windows, analyzes them for patterns, and generates structured trade signals complete with **automatic lot size calculation** based on your predefined risk management rules.

This tool acts as a powerful decision-support system, designed to feed its analysis into an Expert Advisor (EA) or a separate execution script via webhooks.

## ‚ú® Core Features

  - **Hybrid Analysis Engine**: Fuses visual chart analysis from any application with live, accurate price data fetched directly from the Meta-Trader 5 Terminal API.
  - **AI-Powered Decision Making**: Leverages Google Gemini 1.5 Flash to interpret complex chart patterns, indicators, and price action, outputting structured JSON trade signals.
  - **Advanced Risk Management**: Automatically calculates the optimal trade volume (lot size) based on account balance, risk percentage, and stop-loss distance to ensure disciplined trading.
  - **Multi-Asset Support**: Pre-configured with correct contract sizes for various assets, including Gold (`XAUUSD`), Silver (`XAGUSD`), and major Forex pairs. Easily extendable for stocks and indices.
  - **Robust Notifications**: Delivers instant email alerts for both successful analyses and critical errors (e.g., API failures, MT5 connection issues), ensuring you're always informed.
  - **Webhook Integration**: Seamlessly pushes generated trade signals to external systems, such as a trading EA, a Telegram bot, or a database, for execution or logging.
  - **Data Integrity & Fallbacks**: Includes validation logic to handle potentially incomplete AI responses and ensures critical data points like `entry_price` are always present.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Workflow

The script follows a logical, multi-step process for each run:

### Supported Trading Symbols

The system supports various symbols with proper contract size handling:

| Symbol | Description | Contract Size | Risk Unit |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| `XAUUSD` | Gold | 100 oz | Per ounce |
| `XAGUSD` | Silver | 5,000 oz | Per ounce |

2. **Risk Percentage**: Maximum percentage to risk per trade (recommended: 1-3%)
3. **Stop Loss Distance**: Distance between entry and stop loss
4. **Symbol Contract Size**: Proper contract specifications

**Example Calculation**:
```
Account Balance: $10,000
Risk Percentage: 2%
Risk Amount: $200
Entry Price: $2,665.50 (XAUUSD)
Stop Loss: $2,650.50
Price Difference: $15.00
Contract Size: 100 oz
Risk per Lot: $15.00 √ó 100 = $1,500
Calculated Lot Size: $200 √∑ $1,500 = 0.13 lots
```
