# Visual AI Trading Assistant for MetaTrader 5

[](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A sophisticated trading assistant that automates market analysis by combining real-time **MetaTrader 5 API data** with **Google Gemini's visual intelligence**. The system captures trading chart windows, analyzes them for patterns, and generates structured trade signals complete with **automatic lot size calculation** based on your predefined risk management rules.

This tool acts as a powerful decision-support system, designed to feed its analysis into an Expert Advisor (EA) or a separate execution script via webhooks.

## ‚ú® Core Features

  - **Hybrid Analysis Engine**: Fuses visual chart analysis from any application with live, accurate price data fetched directly from the Meta-Trader 5 Terminal API.
  - **AI-Powered Decision Making**: Leverages Google Gemini 1.5 Flash to interpret complex chart patterns, indicators, and price action, outputting structured JSON trade signals.
  - **Advanced Risk Management**: Automatically calculates the optimal trade volume (lot size) based on account balance, risk percentage, and stop-loss distance to ensure disciplined trading.
  - **Multi-Asset Support**: Pre-configured with correct contract sizes for various assets, including Gold (`XAUUSD`), Silver (`XAGUSD`), and major Forex pairs. Easily extendable for stocks and indices.
  - **Robust Notifications**: Delivers instant email alerts for both successful analyses and critical errors (e.g., API failures, MT5 connection issues), ensuring you're always informed.
  - **Webhook Integration**: Seamlessly pushes generated trade signals to external systems, such as a trading EA, a Telegram bot, or a database, for execution or logging.
  - **Data Integrity & Fallbacks**: Includes validation logic to handle potentially incomplete AI responses and ensures critical data points like `entry_price` are always present.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Workflow

The script follows a logical, multi-step process for each run:

2.  Go to `Tools -> Options -> Expert Advisors`.
3.  Check the following boxes:
      - `‚úÖ Allow automated trading`
      - `‚úÖ Allow DLL imports`
4.  Ensure the symbol specified in `TRADE_SYMBOL` is visible in your "Market Watch" panel.

## üöÄ How to Use

### Manual Execution

Run the script directly from your terminal for immediate analysis.

```bash
cd C:\Users\User\Downloads\1073
python capture_task.py
```

### Scheduled Automation (Windows Task Scheduler)

Automate the analysis to run on a schedule (e.g., every hour, or at market open).

1.  **Open Task Scheduler**: Press `Win + R`, type `taskschd.msc`, and press Enter.
2.  **Create Task**: In the "Actions" pane, click "Create Basic Task...".
3.  **Name**: Give it a descriptive name like `MT5 AI Trading Analysis`.

## üßÆ Lot Size Calculation Explained

The script's core risk management feature prevents catastrophic losses by calculating the appropriate trade volume. The detailed calculation is logged for full transparency.

**Formula**:
`Lot Size = (Account Balance * (Risk Percentage / 100)) / ((|Entry Price - Stop Loss|) * Contract Size)`

**Example Log Output**:

```
[2025-09-12 22:59:10] üìä LOT SIZE CALCULATION:
  Symbol: XAUUSD
  Account Balance: $10,000.00
  Risk Percentage: 1.5%
  Max Risk Amount: $150.00
  Entry Price: 2350.5
  Stop Loss: 2345.0
  Price Difference: 5.5
  Contract Size: 100
  Risk per Lot: $550.00
  Raw Calculation: 0.2727
  Final Lot Size: 0.27
  Actual Risk: $148.50 (‚úÖ SAFE)
  Risk Safety Margin: $1.50
```

## üìä Output JSON Format

The final output is a clean JSON object, ready for consumption by another application.

**Market Order Example:**

```json
